### ✅ Testing

- Unit tests pass: `make test` ✅
- All test commands working through Makefile

### ✅ Health Checks

## Benefits Achieved

🚀 **Performance**: Faster installation times due to pnpm's symlink approach  
💾 **Disk Space**: Efficient shared package store reduces duplication  
🔒 **Security**: Stricter dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies  
🐳 **Docker**: More efficient builds with better layer caching  
📦 **Consistency**: Locked dependency versions ensure reproducible builds

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to application functionality
- All existing scripts and commands continue to work through the Makefile
- Docker Compose configurations unchanged
- Development workflow remains the same

## Commands for New Developers

```bash
# Local development
pnpm install
pnpm run start:dev

# Docker development (recommended)
make start          # Build and start development environment
make test           # Run tests
make health         # Check application health
make help           # See all available commands
```

The migration is complete and the project is fully operational with pnpm! 🎉
