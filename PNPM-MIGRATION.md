# Migration to pnpm - COMPLETED ✅

## Migration Status

**✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

This project has been successfully migrated from npm to pnpm as the package manager and bundler. All components of the system now use pnpm:

- ✅ `package.json` updated with pnpm engines and packageManager
- ✅ `Dockerfile` updated to use pnpm via corepack
- ✅ `Makefile` commands updated to use pnpm
- ✅ `package-lock.json` removed and `pnpm-lock.yaml` generated
- ✅ `.dockerignore` updated for pnpm-specific files
- ✅ Docker builds and runtime verified successfully
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect pnpm usage

## What Was Changed

### 1. Update package.json

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "pnpm": ">=8.0.0"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.1"
}
```

### 2. Update Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Docker build for production optimization
FROM node:20-alpine AS development

# Install pnpm globally
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json pnpm-lock.yaml* ./

# Install dependencies
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN pnpm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS production

# Install pnpm globally
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nestjs -u 1001

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json pnpm-lock.yaml* ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod && pnpm store prune

# Copy built application from development stage
COPY --from=development /app/dist ./dist

# Change ownership to non-root user
RUN chown -R nestjs:nodejs /app
USER nestjs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \\
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
```

### 3. Update .dockerignore

Add pnpm-related files:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.npm
.pnpm-store
.pnpm-debug.log*
```

### 4. Update Makefile Commands

Replace npm commands with pnpm:

```makefile
.PHONY: install
install: ## Install dependencies in development container
	docker-compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE_DEV) exec $(SERVICE_NAME) pnpm install
```

### 5. Migration Steps

1. **Backup current state:**

   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "Backup before pnpm migration"
   ```

2. **Generate pnpm-lock.yaml:**

   ```bash
   # Install pnpm locally first
   npm install -g pnpm

   # Remove existing lockfile
   rm package-lock.json

   # Generate pnpm lockfile
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Update Docker setup:**
   - Update Dockerfile
   - Rebuild containers
   - Update Makefile commands

4. **Test the migration:**

   ```bash
   # Rebuild with pnpm
   make rebuild

   # Test all functionality
   make test && make test:e2e
   ```

### 6. Potential Issues

- **Volume mounts**: pnpm creates symlinks that may not work well with Docker volumes on some systems
- **Node modules**: Different structure than npm's node_modules
- **Peer dependencies**: pnpm is stricter about peer dependencies
- **Scripts**: Some npm-specific scripts might need adjustment

### 7. Alternative: Gradual Migration

You could also consider a gradual approach:

1. First test pnpm locally without Docker changes
2. Update local development workflow
3. Then migrate Docker setup
4. Finally update CI/CD

## Migration Benefits Achieved

✅ **Faster installations**: pnpm's symlink-based approach reduces disk usage and installation time  
✅ **Strict dependency resolution**: Prevents phantom dependencies and ensures consistent installs  
✅ **Better security**: Stricter peer dependency handling reduces security vulnerabilities  
✅ **Disk space efficiency**: Shared package store eliminates duplicate dependencies  
✅ **Improved Docker builds**: More efficient caching and smaller layer sizes

## Verification

The migration has been thoroughly tested:

1. **Local development**: `pnpm install` and `pnpm run start:dev` work correctly
2. **Docker development**: Container builds and runs successfully with pnpm
3. **Docker production**: Multi-stage build optimized for production use
4. **All scripts**: Makefile commands updated and tested
5. **Dependencies**: All packages installed correctly via pnpm

## For Future Reference

This migration documentation is kept for reference on how the transition was accomplished.
